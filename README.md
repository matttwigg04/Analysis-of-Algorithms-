# Analysis-of-Algorithms- Time Comparision 

## Details
This was an assignment for my Post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class. 

## Assignment Details
I had to come up with three different algorithms that check if a given number is prime. I was given a .txt file with arrays of integers of increasing length. There are 100 integers in each array with integers of length 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 digits. They are randomly generated integers. I ran my algorithms and timed them, recording the time taken in a file. I recorded the average time taken by each algorithm for a given length number. I plotted this information on a graph comparing the runtime, given the length of the integer.
